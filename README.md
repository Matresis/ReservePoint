### Email Communication System

The ReservePoint system uses an automated email notification system to facilitate communication between users and administrators regarding reservation requests, approvals, modifications, and cancellations.

#### 1. User Reservation Flow with Emails
When a user makes a reservation, the system sends automated emails to both the user and the administrator:

- **User Confirmation Email**:
	- The user receives an email confirming that their reservation request has been submitted.
	- The email includes details of the reservation and a unique reservation ID.

- **Admin Notification Email**:
	- The admin receives an email notifying them of a new reservation request.
	- The email contains a direct link to the reservation details page, where the admin can approve or reject the request.

#### 2. Admin Response and Notifications
Once the admin reviews the reservation request, they take one of the following actions:

- **Approval Process**:
	- If the admin **approves** the reservation, the system updates the database and sends an email to the user confirming the approval.

- **Rejection Process**:
	- If the admin **rejects** the reservation, they must provide a reason.
	- The system then sends an email to the user, informing them of the rejection and including the explanation given by the admin.

#### 3. User-Initiated Requests
Users can make additional requests related to their reservation after it has been approved.

- **Request for Confirmation**:
	- After approval, the user can request an additional confirmation from the admin.
	- The admin receives an email notification about the request.
	- The request appears on the adminâ€™s request management page.

- **Modification Request**:
	- Users can request changes to their reservation (e.g., changing time or service type).
	- The admin receives an email with details of the requested modification.
	- The admin can approve or deny the request, and the user receives an email with the decision.

- **Cancellation Request**:
	- Users can request to cancel their reservation.
	- The admin is notified via email and can approve or reject the cancellation.
	- If approved, the user receives a cancellation confirmation email.

#### 4. Email Content and Templates
Each email contains relevant details and direct links to the reservation page for quick actions. The email system ensures smooth communication, reducing delays in handling reservations.


**View calendar:**
- Admin can view calendar of the reservation system.
- In calendar are all the CONFIRMED reservations added manually by Admin.
